This projet is a Zabbix 5 template to use dhcpd-pools V3.x+ for JSON support ( http://dhcpd-pools.sourceforge.net ) to monitor ISC DHCPD shared network status.

It will create items ( Already Used IP, Defined IP, Free IP, Percent IP already use at least for 1 lease, Percent IP used, Status, Touched IP, Used IP ) for each Shared Network 

Create a trigger on " Percent IP used " base on a macro ( {$PERCENT_IP_USED} with default a 90% ) at severity " Average " and a second trigger on " Free IP " with a macro ( {$MIN_FREE_IP} default at 10 ) at severity " High " for each Shared Network

Also create a graph for each Shared Network that is shown in a screen

You will need to put EnableRemoteCommands=1 on zabbix_agentd.conf of the host that run DHCPD
